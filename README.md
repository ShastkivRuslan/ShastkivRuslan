## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a team project for a public organization, developing a website with features like volunteer applications, donation tracking, and payment integration using LiqPay, all while improving my backend development skills.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Spring Boot, Telegram bot integration, and expanding my expertise with technologies like Docker, AWS, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative backend projects that involve API development, payment systems integration, or business logic implementation.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with perfecting my portfolio projects and gaining insights into building scalable backend architectures for real-world applications.
